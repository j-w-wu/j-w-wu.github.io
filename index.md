### About Me

I received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from shandong university, Jinan, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in radio physics from wuhan university,
Wuhan, China, in 2015. From 2012 to 2014, I worked as a visiting scholar at the center for computational electromagnetics,
university of illinois at urbana–champaign (UIUC), USA. I am currently an associate professor with southeast university, Nanjing, China,
where I am also with the state key laboratory of millimeter waves. I am a member of IEEE and also the IEEE AP-S COPE committee. 


### Research Interests

I study **<red>science based electromagnetic engineering (SBEME)</red>**, and the specific interests include numerical methods in electromagnetics, antennas and metamaterials, and also the theory and technology related to electromagnetic information.
